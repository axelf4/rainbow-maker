					Is your document dull? Is the text making you throw up? Or do
					you just wish you could have more rainbows?
					</p>
					Rainbow Maker is a Google Docs add-on that solves all these
					problems and more, by giving you the option of stylizing your
					everyday text. After just a few weeks of use, you'll never get
					that sweet rainbow taste of your tongue.

			<h2 class="display-4">Frequently asked questions</h2>
			<h3>Rainbow Maker won't show up?</h3>
			Unfortunately this is a problem with Google Docs and nothing I can
			fix. Try giving it some time or refreshing the page.

			<h3>There are now a bajillion colors among my custom colors!</h3>
			Rainbow Maker adds color to the page so this is unavoidable.
			However, revert the text color and the colors will go away.

			<h3>Is it open source?</h3>
			Yes, the <a src="https://github.com/axelf4/rainbow-maker">source
				code is hosted on GitHub</a> under the GPLv3 license.
